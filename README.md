# NeuralNames
A random person name generator backed by a neural network.  The model is fully trained with 3000 popular American names (1000 surnames, 1000 boy names, and 1000 girl names) in order to predict character sequence. Names are generated based on the spelling patterns of the sample data. Light-weight. No dependencies.
